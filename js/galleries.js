	description: "Balata is a refugee camp in the town of Nablus in the West Bank.\
	The site is still administrated by UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency,\
	whose sole purpose is to assist and protect Palestinian refugees.\
	Balata started life as a typical tented camp but now has developed in to a crowded, winding neighbourhood. \
	There is a high unemployment rate and 40% of the population are under 15. \
	However the people are incredibly friendly and hospitable, the kids seem carefree, \
	but a lot of them have injuries, that their elders like to claim are due to Israeli incursions. \
	Posters of martyrs hang off bullet-riddled walls, and many in the neighbourhood have fought for Hamas and other groups. \
	Almost everyone has lost relatives to fighting. The IDF presence is not as strong as it has been, \
	but they have created another generation that will despise them.<br>",

	description: "I spent three months documenting the work of Eventure Zambia. \
	An NGO set up with the purpose of building a school for Zambian teenagers. \
	I arrived on an empty beach on the shore of Lake Tanganyika, there was nothing \
	but a couple of old clay huts and a tent to serve as our kitchen. There were villages \
	nearby but the nearest significant centre was 50 minutes away by boat.  A combination of \
	Danish volunteers and local workers set about turning this forgotten corner of a forgotten \
	country into a special place for Zambian teenagers to realise their potential.\
